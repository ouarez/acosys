      David Acco stands before a projector screen showing off a new software
      system he hopes will answer critics of First Nations financial management.


      After spending the majority of his adult life around software and IT,
      Acco's latest project has been to develop an accounting program intended
      specifically for aboriginal communities.


      The result is the Native Economic Management System. It was created by
      Acco, co-founder of the native consulting firm Acosys Consulting Services
      Inc., and the economic-development commission in the Mohawk community of
      Kahnawake.
