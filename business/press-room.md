      David Acco stands before a projector screen showing off a new software system he hopes will answer
      critics of First Nations financial management.
      After spending the majority of his adult life around software and IT, Acco's latest project has been to
      develop an accounting program intended specifically for aboriginal communities.
      The result is the Native Economic Management System. It was created by Acco, co-founder of the
      native consulting firm Acosys Consulting Services Inc., and the economic-development commission in
      the Mohawk community of Kahnawake.
