## Providing Direction

Acosys is an Aboriginal consulting firm with different ideas. We have expertise in business solutions,
technology integration, and talent management.

We opened our doors in 2006, co-founded by David Acco and Julie Lepage. Their identities, their
vision of social entrepreneurship, and their expertise in the fields of Information Technology and
Human Resources made Acosys what it is.

Since then, our history of efficient delivery and satisfied clients has given us a solid foundation, on
which weâ€™ve built a reputation for creative and progressive solutions catering to nearly every major
industry. In 2011 Acosys was awarded the Small Business of the Year award by the Canadian
Aboriginal and Minority Supplier Council for our strong numbers and new ideas.In 2012 Acosys was
awarded a Business Excellence Award from the Toronto Board of Trade for our leadership and
demonstrated success in Aboriginal inclusion.
