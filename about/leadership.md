      **David Carrière-Acco**, is a member of the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation
      in Saskatchewan. He holds an MBA (International Business Concentration),
      as well as graduate degrees in Marketing, eCommerce and Business Analysis.
      Since launching Acosys in 2006, David has established himself and Acosys
      as a premier Indigenous-led consulting firm specializing in facilitating
      constructive and respectful Indigenous engagement on behalf of
      governments, corporate clients, and non-governmental organizations. David
      has worked with Indigenous communities and organizations across Canada,
      garnering extensive experience in the design, implementation, and
      facilitation of successful Indigenous engagement initiatives. 


      In 2008, David, together with Julie Lepage, created an Indigenous
      Internship Program, which provides the opportunity for Indigenous people
      to work and be mentored on their client projects. This has earned Acosys
      numerous awards and newsworthy media articles. The program has been very
      successful to create opportunity to Indigenous people but also bring
      greater workplace diversity. David believes that the critical part of
      Canada’s path to reconciliation with its Indigenous people is dependent
      upon inclusion in the Canadian economy and workforce within a spirit of
      Nation-to-Nation relationship. 


      In August 2023, David joined McGill University as an Assistant Professor /
      Academic Program Coordinator for the Certificate in Indigenous Business
      Management at the Management and Entrepreneurship Domain, School of
      Continuing Studies.  


      While 2025 saw him complete the prerequisites for his doctorate degree, in
      January 2026, David officially started the research for his doctorate
      thesis at the University of Otago in New Zealand, with a focus on Economic
      Reconciliation and Shared Value Creation.  


      David is passionate about the use of technology combined with Indigenous
      Traditional Knowledge to develop environmental protection and climate
      adaptation solutions for all of Canada and continues his work to build
      Indigenous capacity, especially in STEM professions. He is a proud member
      of the Canadian Armed Forces Reserves as an officer in the Air Cadet
      program, promoting the development of Canada’s youth and interest in
      aviation and aerospace.
